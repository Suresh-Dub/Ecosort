## üìñ Project Description

### Short Description
EcoSort is an AI-driven app that helps users identify recyclable items through image recognition. It also tracks global waste-sorting impact, making eco-friendly decisions accessible and impactful.

### Long Description
EcoSort tackles the global waste crisis by simplifying recycling decisions with AI-powered image analysis. Users can upload an image of a waste item, and EcoSort will classify it as recyclable or not, offering sustainable disposal guidance. The app also includes an analytics dashboard that aggregates and displays users' cumulative contributions, driving global awareness and positive environmental change.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- **Upload an Image**: Users upload a photo of a waste item.
- **AI-Powered Classification**: GPT-4 Vision identifies if the item is recyclable.
- **Impact Dashboard**: A global dashboard displays user contributions, showing the environmental impact over time.

## üîß How We Built It
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and user-friendly experience.
- **AI Integration**: Integrated OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 and GPT-4 Vision models to classify images and provide recycling guidance.
- **Data Analytics**: Created a real-time impact dashboard that displays collective user impact for global awareness.

## üöÄ Challenges We Faced
- Ensuring accurate image classification for diverse waste items.
- Building an intuitive and impactful dashboard for real-time data tracking.
- Optimizing AI performance to provide real-time feedback on recyclability.

## üéâ Accomplishments
- Created an accessible and engaging tool for recycling education.
- Developed an analytics dashboard that motivates eco-conscious behavior.
- Leveraged AI to solve real-world waste management issues.

## üìö What We Learned
- The complexities of AI-driven image recognition in real-world applications.
- The importance of UI/UX design for accessibility and user engagement.
- How real-time data tracking can inspire positive environmental action.

## üîÆ Future Plans
- **Microplastics Detection**: Next, we plan to add functionality to detect microplastics in water, addressing another critical environmental issue.
- **Extended Partnerships**: Future expansions could include collaborations with environmental organizations for wider reach.

## üìù Notes
I'm currently unable to integrate photorealistic 3D maps because I can't create a Google Cloud account and get the API key due to some financial restrictions. However, if this becomes possible, I plan to implement 3D mapping to pinpoint countries with the highest waste-sorting impact. This feature would visually highlight global contributions and further support our mission to address environmental challenges.
